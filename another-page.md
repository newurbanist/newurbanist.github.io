### Places should be designed for people
#### And other ways I think about the world
* * *

<br />

Hi, I'm Jen. I'm an
- economist (ran a multivariate regression once)
- urban planner (zero hours of practice logged)
- aspiring benevolent dictator (would abolish 80% of zoning policies)<br />

<br />

I graduated in 2022 from MIT with dual-degrees in Economics and Urban Planning. I interned as a writer for nearly a year during COVID, crafting language for Tesla's website, app, events and products. On a project partnering with SpaceX to launch stuff into space at Cape Canaveral, I met my longest-term manager at Tesla â€” a leader who left an immense impact on me as both a mentor and a friend. On her Growth team, I managed a fast-paced technical project that drove millions of dollars in both cost savings and direct revenue.
