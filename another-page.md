### _An overview of how I see the world_
* * *

Hi, I'm Jen. I'm an economist (in theory), an urban planner (zero hours in practice), and an aspiring benevolent dictator.

#### Skills
- Nice
- Funny
- Cool

#### Flaws
- Not intelligent
- Struggles with every day tasks
- Maintains twisted, false ideas of what is cool
- Eight-minute attention span (max)
- Continued existence defies the laws of natural selection
- Can be mean if you dislike maps or park your car in the bike lane

#### Facts
_Just stuff that happens to be true_
- I love maps, they are so cool
- I enjoy running very long distances (but only for the bit)
- I teach laser cutting classes in an anarchist makerspace sometimes
