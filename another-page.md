### Places should be designed for people
#### And other ways I think about the world
* * *

<br />

Hi, I'm Jen. I studied as an economist (read: ran an OLS regression, once) and urban planner (read: aspiring benevolent dictator), and emerged a passionate advocate for transit-oriented development, form-based zoning reform and walkable cities.
<br />
<br />

I graduated in 2022 from MIT with dual-degrees in Economics and Urban Planning. I interned and worked as a copywriter at Tesla for nearly two years, writing for Tesla's website, events and products.

As a writer, I managed many projects that had very little to do with writing. To be unbearable, I might say I wore many hats. In one partnership that happened to involve launching a bunch of stuff into space on a Space Force Base, I met an incredible leader at Tesla who took me under her wing and helped me take on more impactful work. On her team, I managed a fast-paced technical project that created millions of dollars of value, both in direct revenue and through reassigned labor costs.
